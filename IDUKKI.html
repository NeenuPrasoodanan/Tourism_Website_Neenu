     <p>The Periyar Tiger Reserve, named after the Periyar river, is one of Kerala's prestigious possessions on the High Ranges of the Western Ghats. Falling in the Idukki district of Kerala, this forest Reserve surrounds the Periyar Lake, which was created in 1895 by building a dam across the Periyar river (to divert the water to Tamil Nadu for irrigation). The forests around the lake were declared as Reserved Forests in 1899.</p>

      <p>Vagamon does not have a long history to boast of as it had remained unexplored for centuries. Though the British had plantations here, it was only in 1926, when Walter Duncan and Company started their tea plantations here, that it became well-known. In the 1930s, more tea plantations were set up in the area. In the 1950s, the famed Kurisumala Ashram was set up here and that was the turning point in its development into a well-known place.

        National Geographic Traveler has listed Vagamon on their directory of the "50 most attractive places to visit in India"</p>>
