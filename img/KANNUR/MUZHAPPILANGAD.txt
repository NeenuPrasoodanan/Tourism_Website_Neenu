Famous as Keralaâ€™s only drive-in beach, the Muzhappilangad offers some of the most stunning views of the yellow and orange sun setting along the golden sandy beaches of Malabar coast. 

The 4 km stretch of land running along the ocean is perfect for taking a romantic, leisurely stroll with your partner or just drive on the beach and soak in the naked natural splendour around. 

Photography enthusiasts can take breathtaking shots of the ocean and food lovers can munch on authentic Malabar snacks sold on the beach.
